Feature: Ads navigation
  As a user I want to be able to navigate from the homepage to the various ads on it
  so that I can get a discount

  Scenario Outline: If I click an ad I should be taken to its location
    Given I am at the home page

    When I click an <ad>

    Then I am navigated to the adâ€™s location

    Examples:
    |ad|
    | |
