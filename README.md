# <i>Engineering 43 Final Project</i>

For our week 10 we have been asigned the task to create a project. In order to complete the project we have to apply all the knowledge we have gain up until this point.
The goal of the project is to test the website:
Selenium <b><a href= http://automationpractice.com/index.php>Automation Practice</a></b> which allows to practice testing skills.

# What needs to be done

The website consists of four main features that require
testing. In order to create test cases for each of them, to make sure that all the features work correctly, what bugs appear and to make sure that correct error messages pop up for given error. The features are as following:
<p>
<b>- Basket</b>

<b>- Pages/Navigation</b>

<b>- Register/ Sign in</b>

<b>- Checkout</b>
</p>

# Prerequisites

In order to complete the project, except from the neccesary knowledge certain tools are required. First most immportant thing was to set up a git hub repository in order to allow the collaboration between everyone when creating the project.
Next It is important to possess a IDE, in our case the IDE used was InteliJ and was set up as a maven project.
Maven project was neccesary as it allowed to carry out tests, as well as add dependecies for reqired tools.
The tools required consist of selenium, cucumber, junit, chrome web driver and the jackson library.

# Installing/ Running the code

In order to run the code and tests it is required to pull the repository from git hub. Once this is done the project needs to be open in IntelliJ and it is possible to proceed with carrying out the tests.
